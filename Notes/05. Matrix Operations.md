`p = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]`


#### Access (i, j) variable of matrix
`p(1,2)`

#### Copy the first row to p1
`p1 = p(1,:)`


#### Extract all elements of all rows and belonging to column 2 to column 3
`p2=p(:,2:3)`

#### Last Column or Row
`lastColumn = p(:,$)`
- `$` is used when last row/column is to be extracted, when size isn't known


#### Matrix inbuilt Functions
`det(p)`
- used to find Determinant of square matrix

`inv(p)`
- used to find Inverse of matrix

`spec(p)`
- Gives eigen values of matrix p

`A^2`
- carot symbol used to calculate power of matrix

`zeros(2,3)`
- Creates zero matrix


`ones(2,3)`
- Creates Ones matrix


`eye(4,4)`
- Creates Identity matrix


`p=rand(3,3)`
- Creates Random matrix
- ##### All elements are between 0 & 1

#### Row Transformation
`p(1,:) = 4*p(1,:) - p(2,:)`
- Makes (1,1) element as 0

#### Add row to Matrix
` x = [ p; [1 2 3] ]`

Row/Col |Col 1  | Col 2  | Col 3  
--|--|---|--
Row 1 | 1  | 2  | 3
Row 2 | 4  |  5 | 6
Row 3 | 7  |  8 | 9
Row 4 | 1  | 2  | 3

### Solving sets of variable

Let A be coefficient Matrix
B be constant Matrix
then
may be given

`X = inv(A) * B`
or by
`X = A \ B`

##### backSlash or Left Matrix Division
- Backslash is the left matrix division: X=A\B is a solution to A*X=B.
- The backslash operator should be used, and the inv() function should be avoided.
