# write()
```
random = rand(20,2)
write('random.txt', random)
readFile = read('random.txt', 20,2)
```
- `write('random.txt', random)` creates a file named `random.txt` with matrix `random`
- `readFile = read('random.txt', 20,2)` reads data from a file named `random.txt` and stores value in a 20x2 matrix

# file = mopen('filePath', mode)
- creates a matrix `file`
- `mode`
  - The default access mode is `rb` (binary file reading).
  - `r`
    - opens for reading (default). The file must exist, otherwise it fails.
  - `w`
    - opens for writing. If the file exists, its contents are destroyed.
  - `a`
    - opens for appending. It creates the file if it does not exist.
  - `r+`
    - opens for both reading and writing. The file must exist, otherwise it fails.
  - `w+`
    - opens for both reading and writing. If the file exists, its contents are destroyed.
  - `a+`
    - opens for both reading and appending. It creates the file if it does not exist.
  - `t`
    - text file
  - `b`
    - binary file (default).
# mclose(file)
- closes the opened file
- if no argument provided, then close last opened file
