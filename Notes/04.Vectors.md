#### Assigning values to matrix
- `p = [1 2 3]`
- `q = [1, 2, 3]`
- both are same
- `p = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]` assigns p as a 2D matrix

#### Basic Operations
- `length(p)`
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication by using respective symbols
- `p'` gives transpose of matrix
- `size(p)` returns a matrix of 1x2 with number of rows of columns
- `[row column] = size(p)` assigns row and column with size of matrix
