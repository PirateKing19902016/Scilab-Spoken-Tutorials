### The faq diff between sci and sce????
- Usual file extensions `.sci` and `.sce`
  - `.sci`
    - Contain Scilab functions and executing them loads the functions into Scilab environment (but does not execute them)
  - `.sce`
    - contain both Scilab functions and executable statements
    - Executing a `.sce` ﬁle has generally an eﬀect such as computing several variables and displaying the results in the console, creating 2D plots, reading or writing into a ﬁle, etc

- Naming not rules but convention followed by community



#### Execute script directly from the console using the follwing command

- `exec("helloworld.sce")`
- Executes the <kbd>helloworld.sce</kbd> file


# Functions

- All functions have return type of a matrix

```
function[x, y] = polar2Rect (r, theta)
  x = r * cos(theta*%pi/180)
  y = r * sin(theta*%pi/180)
endfucntion

```

- syntax is as follows

```
function [return1, return2, return3] = funcName(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3)
  function definition
endfucntion
```

- function calling
- `[x1,y1] = polar2Rect(2, 45)`
 - All Variables in function are local to the function
 - Use <kbd>global</kbd> to  declare a global Variables
 - `global a=10` declares a global Variable with name `a` and value `10`

# Inline functions or Scilab Macros
- keyword `deff`
- no need to explicitly load function from "execute menu option"
- used when body of function is short
- `deff(" [radians] = degree2Radians(degree)", "radians = degree*(%pi/180)")`
- `deff('[x]=myplus(y,z)','x=y+z')`
  - Syntax is as follows
  - `deff(" [return1, return2]" = funcName(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3)", "function definition")`
  -
  - <kbd>deff</kbd> is a function that takes two strings as argument
  - string1 contains <kbd>returnValue</kbd> and <kbd>funcName(parameters)</kbd>
  - string2 contains <kbd>funcDefinition</kbd>
