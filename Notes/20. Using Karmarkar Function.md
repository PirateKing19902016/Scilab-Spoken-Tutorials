# Optimization
- Minimize or maximize a given objective
function
- By varying the decision variables.
- Subject to constraints
-  constraints are in the form of
some functions of the variables


# karmarkar()
- Solves a linear optimization problem.
- Example
```
Minimize : -3x1 - x2 - 3x3
for
2x1 + x2 + x3 <= 2
x1 + 2x2 + 3x3 <=  5
2x1 + 2x2 + x3 <=  6
x1; x2; x3 >= 0
```
- Code is as follows
```
constraints = [2 1 1; 1 2 3; 2 2 1]
constants  = [2; 5; 6]
optimize = [-3; -1; -3]
lb = zeros(3,1)
[optimumSolution, valueAtOptimum, exitFlag, iterationRequired] = karmarkar([], [], optimize, [], [], [], [], [], constraints, constants ,lb )
```

- `optimumSolution` is the optimum `values of vairables x1, x2, x3`
- `valueAtOptimum` gives functions value at `optimumSolution`
- `exitFlag` returns the status of execution
- `optimize` is function to be optimized
- `constraints` is coefficients of x1, x2, x3, in the constraints matrix
- `constants` is the RHS of constraints
- `lb` is a 3x1 zeros matrix
